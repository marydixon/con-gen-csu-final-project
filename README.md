# con-gen-csu-final-project

Here is the repo for my final project! 

Briefly, these data and corresponding code are for a recent small greenhouse project involving subjecting maize plants to low-phosphorus (P) stress. Maize seedlings were planted in soils with low bioavailable P but higher total P. Therefore, to grow without showcasing symptoms of P deficiency, maize must induce P-starvation strategies, such as accumulating an abundance of P-solubilizing bacteria in the rhizosphere. Half the maize plants were fertilized to P sufficiency, and half were left unfertilized. After the growing cycle concluded, we harvested and collected rhizosphere soil samples. We froze the soil samples and extracted DNA. Using Illumina sequencing, we amplified the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. 

Here, you will see the use of the tourmaline workflow which utilizes qiime and Snakemake to process Illumina outputs from the recent experiment I conducted. I have 20 fastq files which comprise 10 replications of 2 fertilizer treatments (P fertilized and P unfertilized). 

(this readme file will have more information about each file in the repo later)
